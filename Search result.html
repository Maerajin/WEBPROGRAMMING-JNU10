    <h1 id="Major">Major Subject</h1>
    <p>There are a total of four major subjects in the Department of Computational Statistics and the first grade.</p>
    <p>Computer majors such as advanced programming and web programming are easy to understand, but difficult to utilize</p>
    <p>All mathematics majors such as statistics and college math are difficult, but tests are easy.</p>
    <p>I am satisfied with the balance of my major as a whole.</p>
    <hr />

    <h1 id="Statistics">Statistic Mathematics</h1>
    <p>The subject is right in terms of "parallel algebra" rather than "statistical."</p>
    <p>That's what the professor said. Until now, I've learned nothing but vectors and matrices, so I didn't feel that difficult.</p>
    <p>You don't have to be so scared because midterms are easier than you think.</p>
    <p>However, if homework is not as diligent as expected, it will be difficult to get good grades.</p>
    <hr />

    <h1 id="College">College Mathematics</h1>
    <p>his is a major subject that I took in the first semester, which is an extension of my college math.</p>
    <p>It is a class taught by a professor of mathematics, and the examination is generally easy.</p>
    <p>But the class is a little boring, so it takes a little effort to keep up with the class.</p>
    <hr />

    <h1 id="Senior">Senior Programming</h1>
    <p>Advanced programming is the subject that I took for the first time in the second semester, which is the extension of the SW development base that I took in the first semester.</p>
    <p>Whereas the compiler is used in the SW development base for learning C++, the Dev C++ is used in advanced programming.</p>
    <p>The class is generally easy and interesting because there are many simple quizzes on that day.</p>
    <hr />

    <h1 id="Web">Web Programming</h1>
    <p>This is my first major in learning HTML5.</p>
    <p>The course is simple, so it is easy to understand, but difficult to test.</p>
    <p>This web programming midterm was to make a site by assembling a group, but I think many students must have suffered because they didn't learn much from the midterm.</p>
    <p>To make matters worse, the student who first met Git doubled the pain because the submission method had a unique way of submitting Github.</p>
    <p>But it's a little hard to find and create a site like this, but it's fun.</p>
    <hr />

    <h1 id="Refine">Refinement Subject</h1>
    <p>I don't know the subjects my department listens to because there are many liberal arts subjects.</p>
    <p>So now I will focus on the liberal arts that I listen to.</p>
    <p>The subjects I am taking now are macroeconomics, European regional studies, intermediate life coding, and English reading2.</p>
    <hr />

    <h1 id="Economy">Macroeconomics academy theory</h1>
    <p>Macroeconomics is a major in economics at Gyeongsang National University.</p>
    <p>I was interested in the economy and applied for the subject because I thought it would be good to hear.</p>
    <p>It was good at the beginning of the semester, but it was one of the subjects that regretted the application as the midterm exam approached over time.</p>
    <p>I can't concentrate on the class because the professor has a lot of Saddam.</p>
    <p>He doesn't check attendance very often</p>
    <hr />

    <h1 id="European">European Regional Theory</h1>
    <p>The theory of regional studies in Europe is a subject dedicated to the German language department at the College of Humanities.</p>
    <p> I applied for this subject because I still have an application grade and my brother in the German language department had a good</p>
    <p>I liked the contents of the class because it was a subject that I applied for to study history and time.</p>
    <p>However, I am not comfortable with the group announcement.</p>
    <p>The midterm is expected to be easy.</p>
    <hr />

    <h1 id="Intermediate">Intermediate Life Coding</h1>
    <p>ntermediate life coding is an intensive life code class in the first semester and learns about Python.</p>
    <p>The professor is the same as the professor who teaches advanced programming.</p>
    <p>Python's code was easy, so the class was generally well understood and the problem was easy to solve.</p>
    <p>But I think this midterm will be difficult.</p>
    <hr />

    <h1 id="English">English Reading2</h1>
    <p>It is the only basic training that I take in the second semester, and I applied for it because I thought it was a conversation in English, but I was very embarrassed by my expectation and other methods.</p>
    <p>The day of this class was a lot of holidays, so I only had three classes.</p>
    <p>It's one of the classes that worries me how the midterm will turn out. </p>
    <p>I think I'll feel good if I see it well.</p>
